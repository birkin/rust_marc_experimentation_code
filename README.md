next -- look through marc-xml files for a bibnum.

exploring xml for:
<https://bruknow.library.brown.edu/permalink/01BU_INST/9mvq88/alma991043515515806966>

for previous bib work, see:
`bib_redirect_stuff/bib_redirect_code/bib_redirector`

looks like a standard bib is b1234567, and b12345678 with a check-digit ('8' there isn't algorithmically correct).
